# Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a robot

TicTacToe is a project intended primarily as didactic purposes as a relatively simple example of the capabilities of robotics and computational vision.

It is intended for use on a computer or the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform.  The robot is an ABB IRB120.

The main library used is OpenCV for the vision module.

In the first instance the communication is by TCP/IP to matLab and then by OPC to RobotStudio and from there to the IRC5 controller.
